    What Is Aprilcoin? 
----------------------------

Aprilcoin is a Proof of Stake Cryptocurrency. 

Why Aprilcoin?
--------------------------

It is the goal of the Aprilcoin developers for everyone involved in the Cryptocurrency revolution to have access to the exciting developments that have been taking place. An ASIC-friendly, mixed PoW/PoS coin with eventual anonymous transaction capabilities has been sorely overlooked.

The Aprilcoin developers believe that progress should never be held back. ASICs use much less energy than GPUs and are orders of magnitude more efficient. The energy used mining Scrypt coins for years to prolong the days of GPU mining was a truly enormous waste of resources on a global scale. Why hold back progress? Aprilcoin encourages it.

Aprilcoin was fixed by PressTab in 2015 to address a faulty POS which was increased to 125% via community voting.

Aprilcoin is formerly known as Analcoin and decided to rebrand to Aprilcoin after the adult market has become crowded.
